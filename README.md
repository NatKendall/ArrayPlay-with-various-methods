# ArrayPlay-with-various-methods
Created Spring 2022- A package with two classes and multiple methods to work with arrays

In Main class the instructions were as followed 
•	You will create an array object that will hold 5 elements of int type called IDArray.
•	You will create and initialize the employee objects using the constructor from arrayPlay
•	You will print the run as shown in the sample other than the part that is handled by the displayResults method.

• The employeeArray array values will be Susan, Bill, Margo, Pamela, and Abe.
• The IDArray array values will be 123, 245, 789, 354, and 256.

--For class Arrayplay
•	Create two private data members called employName and ID.
•	The class constructor will have two parameters and will set the employName and ID to their parameters.
•	This class will have 4 methods.
1.	Method 1 will be called sortArray and it will be invoked to sort the names and then, invoked to sort the IDs.
2.	Method 2 will be called linearSearch will do a linear search on the IDArray looking for the value of 354. This method must use recursion. The base case is that the value is not in the array.
3.	Method 3 will be called binarySearch will do a binary search on the employeeArray looking for the value of Bill. You may use the Arrays class for this method.
4.	Method 4 will be called displayResults and will be used to display the data
